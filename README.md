phl-vacancy
===========

A project to create accurate, open, and shareable vacancy information for property in the City of Philadelphia


Preliminary Project Goals
--------------------------

A data store & API. How can we create a shared data source on vacancy, rather than individually assembling, 
replicating, and storing data? As a starting point for discussion, it would:

* pull from the city's existing data sources & only store additonal data as necessary
* Allow individual (authorized) application developers to add crowd sourced data for a set of basic information
* while at the same time be completely decoupled from any application-specific data
* provide a way to manage and merge conflicting data -- so data is not overridden
* provide an interface for the City to verify crowd sourced data and pull it back into their official data store
be hosted, funded, and managed in some type of relationship with the City to better guarantee longevity, openness, 
and transparency
